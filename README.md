# Sentiment Analyser
Sentiment analysis (SA) is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques.
It’s estimated that people only agree around 60-65% of the time when determining the sentiment of a particular text. 
Tagging text by sentiment is highly subjective, influenced by personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs. 
By using a centralized sentiment analysis system, companies can apply the same criteria to all of their data, helping them improve accuracy and gain better insights.

## An Artificial Intelligence model is implemented in three steps:
1) Pre-processing
2) Training
3) Evaluation

### Tools used: 
Programming language:- python
Framework:
1) NumPy is a package in Python used for Scientific Computing. NumPy package is used to perform different operations. The ndarray (NumPy Array) is a multidimensional array used to store values of same datatype. These arrays are indexed just like Sequences, starts with zero.
2) Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter
3) Scikit-learn is a free machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours, and it also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
4) pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive.
